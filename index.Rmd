# Introduction and motivation

The RSPCA is Australiaâ€™s oldest, largest and most trusted animal welfare organization and, according to its description, there is a gradual increase in the number of animals received each year in animal shelters and adoption centers across the country @About_Us. With this comes an ever increasing amount of pressure and stress on the organisation as it is forced to develep an abundance of new methods to deal with this growing count.

In addition to this, many articles and posts online have recently been indirectly blaming the RSPCA for their high euthanization rates in their centres as some see the worst side of the organisation @powell_2020. This thus motivated the following primary question for the subsequent analysis:

> How does the RSPCA manage animal outcomes across Australia?

Once this research area was established, 5 subsequent analysis questions were determined. They were:  

1. How effective are the RSPCA at producing 'good outcomes' for animals in Australia?  
2. Is there a relationship between the type of animal and its outcome?  
3. Do cats tend to be more often adopted or reclaimed than dogs from Australian RSPCA?  
4. What are the most frequent complaints in Brisbane?  
5. How the different type of complaints are distributed in dogs and cats?  

During the research conducted, multiple articles and web pages dedicated to the adoption of animals that have been in the care of RSPCA were uncovered. If you are interested in adopting an animal, please click this [link](https://www.rspca.org.au/adopt-pet). @Adopt_A_Pet

# Data description

There are three data tables separately coming from the RSPCA, Townsville Animal Complaints, and Brisbane Open Data - Animal Complaints.

__1. animal_outcomes.csv__

*year*: Full year

*animal_type*: Animal type (horse, wildlife, dog, cat, etc)

*outcome*: 	Animal outcome - euthanized, released, rehomed, etc

*ACT*: ACT - Australian Capital Territory

*NSW*: New South Wales

*NT*: Northern Territory

*QLD*: Queensland

*SA*: South Australia

*TAS*: Tasmania

*VIC*: Victoria

*WA*: Western Australian

*Total*: Australian Total

__2. animal_complaints.csv__

*Animal Type*: Animal Type

*Complaint Type*: Complaint type

*Date Received*: Date received (Month - year)

*Suburb*: Suburb/region

*Electoral Division*: Electoral Division

__3. brisbane_complaints.csv__

*nature*:	Nature of complaints (animal)

*animal_type*: Animal type

*category*: Category of complaint

*suburb*: Suburb where reported

*date_range*: Date range (typically 1 quarter + year)

*responsible_office*: Responsible office for the complaint

*city*: City (Brisbane)

## Limitations

The animal_outcomes data set has not specified that suburbs, which limit our approach to identifying which suburb has the most common complaint type. This can also help to identify which suburb has the most animal type too by looking into the animal type the complaint was made against. Similarly, the electoral divisions are of no significance with the data frame they are not specified and are not easy to distinguish. 

In the animal_complaints data set the question that comes up is of adoption which the outcome variable talks about reclaimed and rehomed, but it does not tell us if the animals were reclaimed or rehomed in the same state.   

In the brisbane_complaints data set the date range is difficult to apprehend, because of fluctuating ranges and inconsistencies.

# Questions


## Q1: How effective are the RSPCA at producing 'good outcomes' for animals in Australia?

The primary goal of the RSPCA, as stated on their [website](https://www.rspca.org.au/what-we-do), is the contribution to "animal welfare" in Australia. Many animals are taken into care by the RSPCA that are neglected, reported, lost or require professional care. However, sometimes the RSPCA are forced into make the tough decision to euthanize animals when it is the most humane alternative. This could be due to causes such as medical issues or behavioral problems. 

So how effective are the RSPCA at achieving their goal? This question will analyse the RSPCA's success at achieving 'good outcomes' for the animals that come into their care.

For this analysis, the outcomes; rehomed, in care, in stock, reclaimed, released, transferred and currently in care were considered as 'good outcomes', essentially anything beside euthanization. Let us look at the animals saved by RSPCA or the rescue rate. 

```{r rdsmap}

aus_map <- readRDS("oz_map.rds") #loading the rds map file 

```

```{r goodoutcomes}

q1 <- animal_outcomes %>% select(-year, 
                   -animal_type) %>% 
  group_by(outcome) %>%

                    NSW, 
                    NT, 
                    QLD, 
                    SA, 
                    TAS, 
                    VIC, 
                    WA),  
               list( sum),na.rm=TRUE) #suming up the outcomes category wise




q11 <-  pivot_longer(q1, `ACT`:`WA`, 
                     names_to = "State", 
                     values_to = "outcomes") %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = outcome, 
              values_from = outcomes) #wranggling to get better visualizing sense

q12 <- q11 %>% select(State,                                                                                                       good_outcome)           #selecting variables for ease 
                                                                                                    
                                                                                                    
```


```{r states}
aus_map_states <- aus_map %>% 
  left_join(q12, by = c("state_abb" = "State"))  #joining data sets by states
 

```

```{r leaflet, fig.cap="Positive animal outcomes by state"}
colours <- aus_map_states$good_outcome

cpal <- colorNumeric("Blues", colours)

leaflet(aus_map_states) %>%
  addProviderTiles("CartoDB.Positron") %>%
  addPolygons(stroke = FALSE,
              smoothFactor = 0.2,
              fillOpacity = 1,
              label = paste0(aus_map_states$state, " ", round(aus_map_states$good_outcome, digits = 2), "%"),
              color = ~cpal(good_outcome)) %>%
  addLegend("bottomleft", pal = cpal, values = ~good_outcome,
            title = "Percentage of Positive Outcomes",
            labFormat = labelFormat(suffix = "%"))
```

Figure \@ref(fig:leaflet), shows the rate of animals that were in the care of the RSPCA that experienced a 'good outcome', from the year 1999 to 2018 in each state. The plot clearly shows that Western Australia outperformed all other Australian states, recording a rate of over 75% for positive outcomes. In comparison, New South Wales had the lowest 'good outcome' rate at just 53%, followed closely by Queensland at 53%. This suggests that almost half of all animals received by the RSPCA over this time in these states were euthanized, well behind the performance of the other states. Thus, these areas should be of focus for the RSPCA. As this graphic was made interactive, users can hover over any state to explore the exact rate in each region.  

So while it definitely appears that certain states are outperforming others, it is important to consider how this rate has changed over time. Before comparing statistics on a state-by-state basis however, a national overview was produced below in Figure \@ref(fig:ridges). This graphic displays density plots of the distribution of positive outcomes for each year contained within the data set. Reading down the years, a clear improvement in performance can be seen. Beginning in 1999, not only is the average value lower, there is also a lot of variability in the rates recorded between states. However, over the years up until 2018, the average rate improves to approximately 75% nationally without the multi-modal distribution observed previously. This suggests that the RSPCA's success at achieving their primary goal has indeed gotten better over the years.
```{r ridges, fig.cap="Change in positive outcomes over time, with Year on the y-axis and the percentage of positive outcomes on the x-axis"}
library(ggridges)
yearly_aus <- animal_outcomes %>% 
  group_by(outcome, year) %>% 
  summarise_at(vars(ACT, 
                    NSW, 
                    NT, 
                    QLD, 
                    SA, 
                    TAS, 
                    VIC, 
                    WA),  
               list( sum),na.rm=TRUE) %>% 
  pivot_longer(`ACT`:`WA`, 
                     names_to = "State", 
                     values_to = "outcomes") %>%
  group_by(year, State) %>%
  summarise(good_outcome = sum(outcomes[outcome != "Euthanized"])/sum(outcomes)*100) %>%
  mutate(year = as.factor(year))



yearly_aus %>%
  mutate(year = fct_rev(year)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = good_outcome, y = year)) +
  geom_density_ridges(scale = 4) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = "Percentage of Positive Outcomes", y = "Year") +
  ggtitle("Change in positve outcomes over time")
```


Following this, the outcomes over time were further broken down into a state-by-state basis for comparison with Figure \@ref(fig:leaflet). Figure \@ref(fig:time) paints a more positive picture than the map examined earlier. Every state in the country has shown a general trend of improvement over the years captured by the data. New South Wales in particular, the lowest overall, has shown the greatest improvement in recent years. Mousing over the last recorded year, it can be seen that over 96% of animals experienced a 'good outcome' from the RSPCA in 2020. This is far above their overall average of 53%. The only state not too show obvious improvement was Western Australia. The highest averaging state instead maintained its rate over the time frame, with a noticeable drop in 2008 to 52%. This is quite unusual considering its overall performance and the fact that rates of 91% were recorded in both 2007 and 2009. Despite this, the trend across the country is positve for both the RSPCA and the future of Australian animals.

```{r time, fig.cap="Change in positve outcomes over time per state with percentage of positive outcomes on the x-axis and the year on the y-axis, faceted by state"}
yearly_outcomes <- yearly_aus %>%
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year) + 2000)

yearlyplot <- yearly_outcomes %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = good_outcome)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~ State) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = "", y = "") +
  ggtitle("Change in positve outcomes over time per state")

ggplotly(yearlyplot) %>%
  config(displayModeBar = F)
```

Speaking of Australian animals, a final measure to evaluate the RSPCA on is their performance by animal over time.This relationship is explored in Figure \@ref(fig:animaltime). Positively, there is some improvement seen in the outcome of Dogs, Cats and Other Animals in particular with all showing an increased rate of positive outcomes over time. Whereas Horses, Livestock and Wildlife have not shown any observable improvement. Of particular concern is the Wildlife category. While Horses and Livestock have maintained reasonably high rates (above 75%), positive outcomes for Wildlife have hovered around 50%. This thus suggests that almost all wildlife received by the RSPCA are being put down. This is not ideal and thus should be area of improvement for the organistaion to produce better outcomes for these animals.

```


## Q2: Is there a relationship between the type of animal and its outcome?

Expanding on the observations made above in Figure \@ref(fig:animaltime), a second area of interest was considered relating to the relationship between the different types of animal and any one individual outcome. This was chosen as potentially troubling outcomes associated with any one animal could be uncovered and highlighted, leading to better intervention measures by the RSPCA. Figure \@ref(fig:animaloutcomes) below depicts the different proportionate outcomes for each animal across the different outcome types. A proportion was chosen for more direct comparison as the quantity received by the RSPCA was not consistent across the various animal types.  
There are several observations that can be made from the plot. Firstly, the most euthanized animals were Wildlife and Cats by quite a significant margin. This suggests that there are fewer options available when it comes to these two animals. Cats in particular appear to only be euthanized or rehomed with very few owners ever reclaiming their animal. Whearas Dogs for example are much more evenly distributed between euthanized, reclaimed and rehomed indicating a higher change of the dog returning to its orginial owner. Wildlife meanwhile appears to have its own special category of released, which is reasonable considering most domesticated animals wouldn't fare well in the wild. Interestingly, Horses clearly have the highest rate for both currently in care and in stock. This may highlight a willingness to hold onto these animals for a longer period of time compared to others, with most being rehomed at some point.
```{r animaloutcomes, fig.cap="Proportionate outcomes for different animals with proportionate outcome on the y-axis and the animal type on the x-axis, faceted by outcome"}
ind_outcomes <- animal_outcomes %>%
  group_by(animal_type, outcome) %>%
  summarise(count = sum(Total))

ovr_outcomes <- animal_outcomes %>%
  group_by(animal_type) %>%
  summarise(count = sum(Total))

prop_outcomes <- left_join(ind_outcomes, ovr_outcomes, by = c ("animal_type" = "animal_type")) %>%
  mutate(prop = count.x/count.y)

prop_outcomes %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = animal_type, y = prop, fill = animal_type)) +
  geom_col() +
  facet_wrap(~outcome) +
  labs(x = "", y = "Proportionate Outcome", fill = "Animal Type") +
  scale_x_discrete(breaks = NULL) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
  ggtitle("Proportionate outcomes for different animals") +
  theme_bw()
```

As was done before, this measure can also be examined over time. Figure \@ref(fig:animalovtime) shows this relationship for each outcome and animal type. Examining this plot, several key observations can be made. Firstly, the proportion of wildlife released decreased quite signifcantly in the early 2000's in favour of animal transfers. This may indicate a shift in the strategy of the organisation. Secondly, the proportion of all animals being euthanized had decreased in recent years, particularly for Cats which is especially positive considering the results above. Wildlife however, did not follow this trend, dipping down to 30% in 2012 before returning to its normal level of around 60% the next year. Perhaps the strategies used during this year should be reconsidered by the RSPCA. Thirdly, the rate of Dogs being reclaimed has greatly increased, almost doubling from 22% in 1999 to 39% in 2018. Thus, the strategies used for Dogs may provide a template for the organisation to use in its care of other animals. Finally, the level of animals in stock and currently in care has been increasing for horses over time but not for any other animal. This anomaly should be further investigated (note that 'Currently In Care' appears to have replaced 'In Stock' as a classification in 2009).

```
Two further important factors to consider is if these animal outcomes are different for each state and how this has changed over time. To examine this, an animation was made and is displayed in Figure \@ref(fig:anim) below. Each state is highlighted based on the most common proportional outcome for each animal over each year in the data set. Aside from there being some apparent missing data, there are several important findings highlighted by this plot. Firstly, beginning with Cats, it is positive to see that euthanization became less and less common across the country over time in favour of rehoming. Similarly, by 2011, in no Australian state was euthanization the most common outcome for dogs. Horses meanwhile displayed much greater variability in the most common outcome by state indicating perhaps a lack of trend or plan for this animal type. Livestock and Other Animals meanwhile displayed similar trends to Cats with rehoming becoming the preferred method over euthanization. Finally, wildlife appears to have the most missing data with euthanized being the most commonly seen outcome over the time frame with a trend towards released and transferred in the Northern Territory and South Australia in particular in more recent years. As a final note, Western Australia rarely has euthanization as its most common outcome for any animal type which is supports the findings made in Figure \@ref(fig:leaflet).

```


Speaking of euthanization, Figure  \@ref(fig:AustraliaEuthanizationcount), shows us the euthanization count by animal type throughout Australia from the year 1999 to 2018. Cats have the highest recorded euthanization count at 553,956 in Australia under the care of RSPCA. So is it fair to say that Cats are more likely to euthanized than other animals? This question can be answered with modelling.

Figure \@ref(fig:model) attempts to capture the linear relationship between outcome and animal type. The interactivity of the table allows the exploration of several different variables. Firstly, sorting by the r squared value, which measures the explanatory power of the model, it can be seen that the outcome animals being in care by the RSPCA is most directly tied to animal type, followed closely by reclaimed. The ouput can be restricted to just the 'InCare' model by typing this in the box in the top right. Sorting then by the estimate term, it can be seen that Horses are most positively associated with this outcome whereas Wildlife are the lowest. Noticeably the difference between Horses and second highest is much larger than Wildlife and the next lowest. Removing the filter and again sorting by estimate, it can be seen that Dogs actually have the highest positive association with any one outcome - that being reclaimed. Similarly, if the sort is reversed it can be seen that Horses are most negatively associated with euthanization rate followed closely by Dogs. Notably for the relationships above all p values were below the 0.05 significance level indicating that the animal type was significant on the outcome. As the table is interactive, all formed models can be explored. 

```{r model}
library(DT)

model_data <- prop_outcomes_state %>%
  select(year, State, animal_type, outcome, prop) %>%
  group_by(year, State, animal_type) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = outcome, values_from = prop) %>%
  mutate(State = as.factor(State),
         animal_type = as.factor(animal_type)) %>%
  rename("InStock" = "In Stock",
         "InCare" = "Currently In Care")

model_fun <- function(x) {
  model <- lm(paste(x, "~", "animal_type"), data = model_data)
  tidy(model) %>%
    tidycat::tidy_categorical(model) %>%
    dplyr::mutate(Outcome = x)
}

glance_fun <- function(x) {
  model <- lm(paste(x, "~", "animal_type"), data = model_data)
  glance(model) %>%
    select(r.squared) %>%
    mutate(Outcome = x)
}

model_table <- bind_rows(model_fun("Euthanized"),
          model_fun("Reclaimed"),
          model_fun("Rehomed"),
          model_fun("Other"),
          model_fun("InStock"),
          model_fun("Transferred"),
          model_fun("InCare"))  %>%
  select(level, estimate, std.error, p.value, Outcome)

glance_table <- bind_rows(glance_fun("Euthanized"),
          glance_fun("Reclaimed"),
          glance_fun("Rehomed"),
          glance_fun("Other"),
          glance_fun("InStock"),
          glance_fun("Transferred"),
          glance_fun("InCare"))

comb_table <- left_join(model_table,
                        glance_table) %>%
  mutate_at(vars(estimate:std.error, r.squared), funs(round(., 3))) %>%
  mutate(p.value = round(p.value, digits = 6)) %>%
  select(Outcome, r.squared, level:p.value)

datatable(comb_table,
          rownames = FALSE, 
          caption = "Outcome by animal type model statistics", 
          class = "cell-border stripe")
```


## Q5: Cats versus dogs who are more likely to get reclaimed?
 

-> A very interesting question are there more cat people or dog people. 


```{r screening}
animal_outcomes3 <- animal_outcomes %>%
  filter(outcome == "Reclaimed") %>%
  filter(animal_type == c("Dogs", "Cats")) #filtering required animal types
```

```{r plot4, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 6, fig.cap="Reclaimed animals: Timeline", fig.align= "center"}
p4 <-  ggplot(animal_outcomes3, 
              aes( x = year,
              y = Total, 
              group = as.factor(animal_type),
              shape = as.factor(animal_type),
              colour = as.factor(animal_type))) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Reclaimed animals: Timeline") +
  theme(legend.title=element_blank())

ggplotly(p4)
```

In Figure  \@ref(fig:plot4), from 1999 to 2018 the number of reclaimed cats has been stable, while the number of reclaimed dogs has fluctuated over the years. 2009 was a good year for dogs.

### While we are at the subject of cats versus dogs, who gets the most complaints? 

```{r complaints}
x1 <- animal_complaints %>% 
  select(`Animal Type`) %>%  #selecting animal type to get total count oer animal type 
  count() 

```


```{r ComplaintsagainstwhoCatsorDogs, fig.cap="Complaints against who: Cats or Dogs"}
p4e <- x1 %>% ggplot(aes(x = Animal.Type, 
                 y = freq)) + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity", 
           fill="yellow") + 
  ylab("number of complaints") + xlab(" ") +  ggtitle("Complaints Launched")

ggplotly(p4e)
```


Figure  \@ref(fig:ComplaintsagainstwhoCatsorDogs),  shows that dog complaints made by people are disproportionately higher than complaints against cats.

### What are the most frequent complaints in Brisbane?

```{r brisbanecomplaints}
brisbane_complaints_category <- brisbane_complaints  %>% select(category) #selecting category

brisbane_complaints_category <- brisbane_complaints_category %>% 
  group_by(category) %>% 
  tally()                   #getting tally of the compalints made in brisbane

brisbane_complaints_category <- na.omit(brisbane_complaints_category)
```

```{r treemap, fig.cap="Complaints made in Brisbane"}

 p9 <- ggplot(brisbane_complaints_category, 
              ggplot2::aes(area = n,
                           label = category, 
                           fill = category)) + 
 geom_treemap() + 
  geom_treemap_text( stat = "identity", 
                     position = "identity", 
  na.rm = FALSE, 
  show.legend = FALSE, 
  inherit.aes = TRUE, 
  padding.x = grid::unit(1, "mm"), 
  padding.y = grid::unit(1, "mm"), 
  place = "topleft", 
  min.size = 4, 
  grow = FALSE, 
  reflow = FALSE, 
  fixed = NULL, 
  layout = "squarified", 
  start = "bottomleft") 
p9 +  ggtitle("Complaints made in Brisbane")
```

Figure  \@ref(fig:treemap), shows us that in Brisbane the highest complaint rate is Fencing issues, followed by wandering animals, attack on animals, and attack on a person. 

## Q6: How the different type of complaints are distributed in dogs and cats?



# Conclusion

In conclusion, RSPCA does what is best for the animals, there may be other factors involved such as state laws, size of the state, wildlife concentration, population in the state, that needs to be taken under consideration when looking at things such as good outcome rates, euthanization counts, rehomed animals, etc.
